1. PROJECT SUMMARY (PROJECT INTRODUCTION)
The robot developed for our project was designed to operate on a 400x500 cm track with uneven and varied ground conditions. The initial goal was to correctly position the communication station, which provides an additional 60 points. Following this task, the robot was programmed to collect the balls on the track according to their score priority and release them all at once. The collection order includes balls with stars (40 points), black stripes (10 points), and plain (5 points).
Thanks to high-torque motors and a suspension chassis, the robot moves stably on challenging terrain, while wireless control technology allows the operator to precisely guide the balls. The balls are collected safely with a specially designed basket system and placed securely during transport. Field tests demonstrated that the robot successfully positioned the communication station and collected the balls consistently, quickly, and reliably. The innovative features of our project include a task prioritization algorithm, a multi-ball handling system, a power monitoring module, and intuitive user controls. Furthermore, thanks to its modular design, the robot's maintenance and part replacement processes can be performed quickly and easily. In field tests, the successful differentiation of balls of different score types, their collection, and their accurate release into the designated target area demonstrated the effectiveness of our task algorithm.

2.1. Using the Deneyap Card
In our project, we positioned the Deneyap Card as the central control unit of our robot. All motor drivers, joystick module, tilt sensor, buttons, and other peripherals are managed through this card. Thanks to the Deneyap Card's high processing capacity, the ESP32-WROVER-E module allows us to analyze input data and simultaneously send accurate commands to output units. The servo motors used for picking, dropping, and throwing operations on the robot are precisely controlled via the Deneyap Card's PWM outputs. We process signals from the joystick module through the Deneyap Card for data transfer between the driver and operator. The Deneyap Card's built-in Bluetooth feature allows remote control of the robot. However, we also worked on scenarios that minimize latency to mitigate the possibility of frequency interference in the competition environment. We used two Deneyap Cards on the robot: one handles remote control functions, while the other handles tasks such as motor drive, sensor reading, and servo control on the robot chassis. This allows us to share the load between these tasks, ensuring more stable system operation. We actively used the LSM6DSM module on the Deneyap Card to monitor the robot's balance. For power management, we chose to use a multi-output power distribution board to support components requiring different voltages on the robot. This board allows the Deneyap Card to securely power components operating at 3.3V, 5V, and 12V from a single central location. Thanks to this structure, the Deneyap Card serves not only as a control unit but also as a stable and reliable hub, ensuring coordination between all the robot's systems.
Compared to the Preliminary Assessment Report (PAR), the system has undergone significant improvements during the Project Detailed Report (PDR) phase. While the SDR phase only included basic motor control and sensor connections, the PDR phase expanded the system with a dual microcontroller architecture, integrating a joystick-controlled control unit, an OLED display, buttons, and a Bluetooth communication unit. Additionally, multiple Li-Po batteries were used for power distribution, increasing the system's energy continuity. The motor drivers and control units were powered independently, creating a more stable structure. These improvements enabled the robot to move more quickly, safely, and flexibly within its mission area.




2.3. Vehicle Mechanical Design
2.3.1. Mechanical Design Process
2.3.2. Materials Used in Mechanical Design
We prioritized robustness, flexibility, and insulation in the design of our robot. The body is designed with MDF, which is mechanically durable and easy to process. MDF is an economical material, in addition to being resistant to bending and stress. MDF's greatest advantage is its ability to act as an insulator and prevent stray currents. Other components of our robot are designed to be made of PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol) filament. We chose PETG because it has properties such as chemical resistance, flexibility, and shock absorption. These properties make it an ideal material for moving parts and fasteners.
We tried to keep the robot's size as compact as possible. This is to prevent any impact on the terrain's slopes. We also designed the corners with chamfers for the same reason. Accordingly, we determined the dimensions of our robot as 40x25cm.5

2.4. Electronic Design and Software Design
2.4.1. Electronic Design
The electronic design of the robot developed within the scope of our project was created to perform field tasks most efficiently and to be open to intervention during use. In the final design, the Deneyap Card was positioned centrally, and the entire electronic infrastructure was designed around this card. This choice was made because the Deneyap Card's capabilities, such as PWM outputs, analog-digital pinout, and wireless communication support, directly contribute to the robot's missions.
Movement is provided by four high-torque DC motors, which are driven by PWM signals received from the Deneyap Card via L298N motor drivers, enabling dynamic maneuvering. The arm mechanism developed for the robot to perform picking tasks is powered by three servo motors, which directly connect to the outputs of the Deneyap Card and perform opening, closing, and rotation movements. The sensing infrastructure consists of IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and limit switches. These sensors successfully perform obstacle detection, position tracking, and end-of-task control in the field. Our robot is not fully autonomous; it is remotely controlled. Communication with the operator is provided via the HC-05 Bluetooth module integrated into the Deneyap Card, which transmits joystick data to the robot in real time. This communication system allows the robot to perform its field tasks instantly and decisively according to operator commands. A 12V Lipo battery was selected as the power system, and 5V and 9V regulators were used to meet different voltage requirements. This provides a safe and stable power supply to the Deneyap Card, motor drivers, servo motors, and sensors. The cabling is neatly grouped, and a modular structure has been established to facilitate intervention when necessary. Electronic components are securely integrated into the chassis, and field tests have optimized signal stability and energy efficiency. This structure was tested in the field and found to function flawlessly. Considering mission priorities and the robot's movement efficiency, it was decided to use it in its final form.




2.4.2. Software Design
Our robot's software infrastructure was developed using the C/C++ language on the Arduino platform and is designed with a modular structure to ensure the orderly and efficient execution of tasks. This software structure manages each of the tasks, such as processing sensor data, obstacle avoidance, ball detection, grasping the ball with the robot arm, and depositing it at the designated target point, through separate modules. In the main control loop, the robot first scans its environment using an ultrasonic sensor. If it detects an obstacle, it changes direction to avoid collisions. If no obstacle is detected, it moves to the ball search and task execution phase. When the ball is detected, the robot arm, controlled by servo motors capable of movement in three axes, is activated. It grasps the ball according to its position, carries it safely, and deposits it into the targeted basket. The software works in harmony with the hardware throughout this process, ensuring the robot performs its tasks with high accuracy and stability. In addition, the robot can be controlled remotely via wireless using the HC-05 Bluetooth module. This allows it to perform environmental tasks autonomously in automatic mode and respond to user commands manually. The hardware used an Arduino UNO or Nano microcontroller board, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, three servo motors, a motor driver board, and a Bluetooth communication module. The software used libraries such as Servo.h, NewPing.h, and SoftwareSerial.h, along with the Arduino C/C++ language, and the entire development process was conducted through the Arduino IDE.7

3. METHODOLOGY
In the second phase of the competition, we developed a comprehensive mission planning and control strategy to ensure our robot completed its field tasks completely, reliably, and with high efficiency. In developing this strategy, we considered many factors, including the order of tasks, the robot's physical structure, ground conditions, driving dynamics, and the response time of our control system. We implemented a custom joystick control system based on RF communication technology to guide our robot. Thanks to this system, our robot is controlled entirely manually, requiring no operator intervention.
Our wireless control system offers low latency and high signal stability, ensuring the operator's instantaneous maneuvers are seamlessly transmitted to the robot on the competition field. The communication station placement task is integrated into the robot's overall operation as an integral part of our mission planning. After leaving the starting point, the robot first possesses the hardware and mechanical structure to safely and decisively transport and successfully place the communication station at the target location. The necessary electronic connections and transport mechanism have been optimized to perform this task seamlessly in the field. The communication station placement task was both a priority in the mission sequence and has yielded successful results in tests. We aim to complete this task completely during the competition. When determining the order of the balls to be collected, we used the scoring system as a basis, aiming to collect the highest-scoring balls first. Therefore, it will collect the star balls (40 points) first, followed by the black striped balls (10 points), and finally the plain balls (5 points). We divided the field into three zones based on the ball positions and planned the transitions between these zones along the shortest and least-obstructive routes. We defined a separate guidance strategy for each zone. This allows our robot to avoid unnecessary maneuvers to complete tasks, saving energy and time. The ball collection process is carried out using a gripper mechanism controlled by the operator using a joystick. This mechanism transfers the balls to the transport hopper, which is designed to hold them securely during movement. The internal structure of the hopper is designed to secure the balls at different levels according to their type, ensuring problem-free operation. Our robot's entire mission process was visually planned using a block diagram. This diagram illustrates the entire process, from the start to the deposit of the balls into the scoring zone, along with decision points and alternative scenarios. Our operator carefully performs the tasks sequentially and in accordance with this diagram. We have also taken precautions against potential risk scenarios. For example, in the event of a communication interruption, the robot automatically shuts down. When the battery level reaches a critical level, a warning LED illuminates and a visual alert appears on the joystick display. Thanks to this detailed planning and control approach, our robot's field tasks are performed with low margins of error, high time management, and optimized for energy efficiency.
